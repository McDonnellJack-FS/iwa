          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong> is an epic[1] high fantasy
            novel[a] by the English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in
            Middle-earth, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937
            children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much
            larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of
            the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over
            150 million copies sold.[2] The title refers to the story's main
            antagonist,[b] the Dark Lord Sauron, who in an earlier age created
            the One Ring, allowing him to rule the other Rings of Power given to
            men, dwarves, and elves, in his campaign to conquer all of
            Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land
            reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across
            Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring, seen
            mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and
            Pippin. Aiding the hobbits are the wizard Gandalf, the men Aragorn
            and Boromir, the elf Legolas, and the dwarf Gimli, who unite as the
            Company of the Ring in order to rally the Free Peoples of
            Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give Frodo a chance to
            destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.

          <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            <em>Bilbo Baggins</em> celebrates his birthday and leaves the Ring
            to Frodo, his heir. Gandalf (a wizard) suspects it is a Ring of
            Power; seventeen years later, he confirms it was lost by the Dark
            Lord Sauron and counsels Frodo to take it away from the Shire.
            Gandalf leaves, promising to return, but fails to do so. Frodo sets
            out on foot with his cousin Pippin Took and gardener Sam Gamgee.
            They are pursued by Black Riders, but meet some Elves, whose singing
            to Elbereth wards off the Riders. The Hobbits take an evasive
            shortcut to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry
            Brandybuck. Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and
            insist on joining Frodo on his journey. They try to shake off the
            Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest. Merry and Pippin are
            trapped by the malign Old Man Willow, but are rescued by Tom
            Bombadil. Leaving Tom's house, they are caught by a barrow-wight.
            Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil,
            who frees them and gives them ancient swords from the wight's hoard.
            The Hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they meet Strider, a
            Ranger. The innkeeper gives Frodo an old letter from Gandalf, which
            identifies Strider as a friend. Knowing the Black Riders will
            attempt to seize the Ring, Strider guides the group toward the
            Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell. At Weathertop, they are attacked by
            five Black Riders. Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade.
            Strider fights them off and treats Frodo with the herb athelas. They
            are joined by the Elf Glorfindel, who rides with Frodo, now deathly
            ill, towards Rivendell. The Black Riders pursue Frodo into the Ford
            of Bruinen, where they are swept away by flood waters summoned by
            Elrond.
          </p>
          <h3>The Fellowship</h3>
          <p>
            Frodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care. Gandalf informs
            Frodo that the Black Riders are the Nazgûl, Men enslaved by Rings of
            Power to serve Sauron. The Council of Elrond discusses what to do
            with the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir of
            Isildur who had cut the Ring from Sauron's hand in the Second Age,
            but claimed it for himself. The Ring was lost when Isildur was
            killed; it passed to Gollum and then to Bilbo. Gandalf reports that
            the chief wizard, Saruman, is a traitor. The Council decides that
            the Ring must be destroyed in the fire of Mount Doom in Mordor,
            where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond
            chooses companions for him: Sam, Merry, and Pippin; Gandalf; the Men
            Aragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor; the Elf Legolas;
            and the Dwarf Gimli, representing the Free Peoples of the West.
            After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains, the Fellowship
            risk the path through the Mines of Moria. They learn that Balin and
            his Dwarves, who had attempted to regain possession of Moria, were
            killed by Orcs. They are attacked by Orcs and a Balrog, a fire
            demon. Gandalf confronts the Balrog: both fall into an abyss. The
            others escape to the Elvish forest of Lothlórien, where the Lady
            Galadriel tests their loyalty, and gives them magical gifts. She
            allows Frodo and Sam to look into her vision-giving fountain, the
            Mirror of Galadriel. Frodo offers her the Ring: she refuses, knowing
            that it would master her. Galadriel's husband Celeborn gives the
            Fellowship boats, cloaks, and waybread. They travel down the River
            Anduin. At Amon Hen, Boromir tries to take the Ring, but Frodo puts
            on the Ring and disappears. Frodo chooses to cross the river and go
            alone to Mordor, but Sam, guessing what he intends, intercepts him.

          <h2>Legacy</h2>
          <p>
            The enormous popularity of Tolkien's work expanded the demand for
            fantasy. Largely thanks to The Lord of the Rings, the genre flowered
            throughout the 1960s and enjoys popularity to the present day.[129]
            The opus has spawned many imitations, such as The Sword of Shannara,
            which Lin Carter called "the single most cold-blooded, complete
            rip-off of another book that I have ever read,"[130] as well as
            alternate interpretations of the story, such as The Last Ringbearer.
            The Legend of Zelda, which popularized the action-adventure game
            genre in the 1980s, was inspired by The Lord of the Rings among
            other fantasy books.[131][132] Dungeons & Dragons, which popularized
            the role-playing game genre in the 1970s, features several races
            from The Lord of the Rings, including halflings (hobbits), elves,
            dwarves, half-elves, orcs, and dragons. However, Gary Gygax, the
            lead designer of the game, stated that he included these elements as
            a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the
            time he was developing the game.[133] Because Dungeons & Dragons has
            gone on to influence many popular games, especially role-playing
            video games, the influence of The Lord of the Rings extends to many
            of them, with titles such as Dragon Quest,[134][135] EverQuest, the
            Warcraft series, and The Elder Scrolls series of games[136] as well
            as video games set in Middle-earth itself.

          <h3>Adaptations</h3>
          <p>
            A variety of filmmakers considered adapting Tolkien's book, among
            them Stanley Kubrick, who thought it unfilmable,[99][100]
            Michelangelo Antonioni,[101] Jim Henson,[102] Heinz Edelmann,[103]
            and John Boorman.[104] A Swedish live action television film, Sagan
            om ringen, was broadcast in 1971.[105] In 1978, Ralph Bakshi made an
            animated film version covering The Fellowship of the Ring and part
            of The Two Towers, to mixed reviews.[106] In 1980, Rankin/Bass
            released an animated TV special based on the closing chapters of The
            Return of the King, gaining mixed reviews.[107][108] In Finland, a
            live action television miniseries, Hobitit, was broadcast in 1993
            based on The Lord of the Rings, with a flashback to Bilbo's
            encounter with Gollum in The Hobbit.[109][110]
          </p>
          <h4>Motion Picture</h4>
          <p>
            A far more successful adaptation was Peter Jackson's live action The
            Lord of the Rings film trilogy, produced by New Line Cinema and
            released in three instalments as The Lord of the Rings: The
            Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
            (2002), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003).
            All three parts won multiple Academy Awards, including consecutive
            Best Picture nominations. The final instalment of this trilogy was
            the second film to break the one-billion-dollar barrier and won a
            total of 11 Oscars (something only two other films in history,
            Ben-Hur and Titanic, have accomplished), including Best Picture,
            Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.[111][112] Commentators
            including Tolkien scholars, literary critics and film critics are
            divided on how faithfully Jackson adapted Tolkien's work, or whether
            a film version is inevitably different, and if so the reasons for
            any changes, and the effectiveness of the result.[113]
